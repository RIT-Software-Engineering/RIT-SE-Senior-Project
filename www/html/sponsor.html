                                <li>Teams generally consist of four or five seniors. Students work on the project for two terms (about 30 weeks). During this time, each team member is expected to devote an average of ten hours/week on the project.</li>
                                <li>Project scope should be determined with this level of effort in mind. Also remember that it is unlikely that students will have detailed knowledge of the sponsor's domain. Time for acquiring this knowledge must be factored into the project’s scope.</li>
                                <li>If your project has a scope beyond software, we can work with the other colleges at RIT to create a multi-disciplinary team that covers all the aspects of your project.</li>
                                <li>We are interested in projects from any application domain, and of any type including web-based systems, desktop applications, or embedded projects. A project should require the team to demonstrate their software engineering skills including requirements elicitation, 
                                    design and implementation, and deployment. Our past experience has shown that web-based projects which are only client-side website development or a web interface to a database without significant backend business logic are too small in scope to require the students 
                                    to demonstrate this full range of skills. Mobile aps by themselves are usually too small in scope. However, a mobile which is the front-end to a larger system that the team must also create does typically have sufficient scope. If you have any questions, contact the

                                    <li>Prepare an initial project description summary.</li>
                                    <li>Provide any hardware and software not currently available at the RIT facilities, including software licenses or remote access so that the team can perform all project work from the RIT facilities. 
                                        Hardware and software can be a permanent donation to the Department of Software Engineering or loaned only for the project duration.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Ensure the accessibility of personnel throughout the project to help the team understand both the domain and the problem being addressed - 
                                        such accessibility is particularly critical during the initial phases and will require that the sponsor's personnel participate in meetings at RIT, or remotely with the student team.

                                <li>Any comments and editing suggested by the Senior Project Coordinator is the first review. The Coordinator rarely removes a proposal at this point, and passes all proposals to the next review stage. You should, however, address the Coordinator's comments because they typically track the comments made in the second review stage.</li>
                                <li>We have always been in the fortunate position to receive more project proposals than the number of teams we will have. The software engineering faculty do the second review and vet proposals down to 2 or 3 more than the number of teams we will have. The top reasons for discarding a proposal are: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The scope is too small</li>
                                        <li>The scope has a limited range particularly when limited to mostly data analysis or algorithm development instead of the full-scale engineering of a significant software system</li>
                                        <li>A project description that left a majority of the reviewers wondering what the team was really going to do.</li>

                        <h3>Project Agreements and Assignment of Rights</h3>
                        <p>RIT policy gives students full ownership of any work done as part of coursework which includes their work on senior project. 
                            As the sponsor of a course project, you can select one of three approaches for dealing with ownership of project artifacts 
                            and intellectual property, and the disclosure of proprietary information. If you seek assignment of rights, the individual 
                            team members will sign a project agreement based on the rights that you want.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please get any corporate and legal clearances that you feel are needed to use the unmodified project agreement, before 
                            submitting your project proposal. This is necessary to prevent any delays in starting a project. A team will not be assigned 
                            to a project if the sponsor has not confirmed that the project agreements are OK. Indicate that this has been done by checking 
                            box below.
                        </p>
