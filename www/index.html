                <p class="overviewText" >Senior Project is a capstone course completed by every Software Engineering senior. 
                    Small teams of students are assigned to solve challenging, real-world software issues 
                    for companies and organizations. External corporate and non-profit sponsors submit proposals 
                    for projects that teams of 4 or 5 students will work on.</p>
                <p class="overviewText" >Over the course of two terms, each team works with a project sponsor, applying the software engineering 
                    skills that the students learned in class and on co-op. They carry the project from inception through an entire software 
                    development lifecycle. The end result is a functional software tool ready for use by the sponsor's organization.</p>

ASL and other sign based communication modalities in some instances do not mark all English word forms and word roots. The vocabulary program provides a platform for teachers to strengthen student skills through repetition and various forms of enforcements. Teachers would be able to construct and share lessons that focus on specific sets of words. These lessons would include information such as context sentences, definitions, roots, synonyms, and antonyms. The lessons will be populated with existing corpus references, but will allow for editing by teachers for further customization. Teachers will then be able to assign lessons to students for completion and the program will provide metrics of success after the completion of a lesson. These metrics will encompass grading as well as give information about certain aspects of the lesson such as completion time and completion percentage. The program will be accessed through a web portal. The focus of the project will be to create one model lesson that is thoroughly vetted and will systematically produce a stable and simple workflow for both teachers and students alike.</p>
